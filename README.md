# Search-Engine-using-Python
Implemented a "search engine" with high query-result proficiency which read a corpus of files and produced TF-IDF vectors for 
documents in the corpus.
When given a query string, code returns the document with the highest cosine similarity score for the query.
Used modules (stemming, removal of stop words, tokenizing) in NLTK-a natural language processing toolkit for Python.
